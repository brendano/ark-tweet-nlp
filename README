CMU ARK Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger v0.2
http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/

Basic usage
-----------

Requires Java 6.  To run the tagger:

    ./runTagger.sh -input example_tweets.txt -output tagged_tweets.txt

The output should match tagged_tweets_expected.txt.

Advanced usage
--------------

We include a pre-compiled .jar of the tagger so you hopefully don't need to
compile it.  But if you need to recompile, do:
  mvn install

To train and evalute the tagger, see:
  ark-tweet-nlp/src/main/java/edu/cmu/cs/lti/ark/ssl/pos/SemiSupervisedPOSTagger.java
  scripts/train.sh and scripts/test.sh

Contents
--------
 * runTagger.sh       is the script you probably want
 * lib/               dependencies
 * ark-tweet-nlp/src  the project code itself (mostly java, and one bit of scala)

Version 0.2 of the tagger differs from version 0.1 in the following ways:

* The tokenizer has been improved and integrated with the tagger in a single Java program.

* The new tokenizer was run on the 1,827 tweets used for the annotation effort and the
annotations were adapted for tweets with differing tokenizations. The revised annotations
are contained in a companion v0.2 release of the data (twpos-data-v0.2).

* The tagging model is trained on ALL of the available annotated data in twpos-data-v0.2.
The model in v0.1 was only trained on the training set.

* The tokenizer/tagger is integrated with Twitter's text commons annotations API.
