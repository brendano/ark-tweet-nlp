For this branch only:

If you are on a Windows machine, you should use the CMUTweetTaggerWindows.py file to run the tagger.

It might not work on Mac or Linux, but will work on Windows.

Please contact Kevin Zhao(kevinzhao53@gmail.com) if you encounter any trouble with the Windows wrapper.

You can find the Python wrapper for Mac/Linux OS at https://github.com/ianozsvald/ark-tweet-nlp-python.  It's a pretty awesome
program.

For all branches:

CMU ARK Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger v0.3.2
http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/

Basic usage for released version
================================

Requires Java 6.  To run the tagger on example data, try:

    java -Xmx500m -jar ark-tweet-nlp-0.3.2.jar examples/example_tweets.txt

where the jar file is the one included in the release download.
The tagger outputs tokens, predicted part-of-speech tags, and confidences.
Use the "--help" flag for more information.  On Unix systems, "./runTagger.sh"
invokes the tagger; e.g.

    ./runTagger.sh examples/example_tweets.txt
    ./runTagger.sh --help

We also include a script that invokes just the tokenizer:

    ./twokenize.sh examples/example_tweets.txt

You may have to adjust the parameters to "java" depending on your system.

If instead you are using a source checkout, see docs/hacking.txt for info.

Information
===========

Version 0.3 of the tagger is much faster and more accurate.  Please see the
tech report on the website for details.

For the Java API, see src/cmu/arktweetnlp; especially Tagger.java.
See also documentation in docs/ and src/cmu/arktweetnlp/package.html.
